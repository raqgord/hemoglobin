# hemoglobin
This repository contains python scripts for fitting oxygen hemoglobin binding data.
THis script uses data for hemoglobin binding from Ferry and Green, JBC (August 17, 1928) 
and fits the data with the Adair function from M. F. Perutz et al., Annual Reviews 1998,
and shows the residual. It then fits the same data with the Pauling function from Lionas 
Pauling, PNAS (1935).
